# Homepage Repair Summary

## What Was Broken

1. **Wrong File Serving**: `welcome.blade.php` was being used instead of the proper Livewire `Home` component
2. **Asset Loading Broken**: Referenced non-existent `public/style.css` and `public/script.js`
3. **No Design System**: Hardcoded styles instead of using CSS tokens and utilities
4. **No Component Reuse**: Duplicated markup instead of Blade components
5. **Icon Sizing Issues**: Icons were improperly sized and competing with text
6. **Spacing Violations**: Random padding/margins instead of 8-point system
7. **No i18n**: Hardcoded strings instead of translation files
8. **Banned Content**: Mentioned "board game café" on public homepage
9. **No Conversion Focus**: Multiple competing CTAs, no clear primary goal

## What Was Fixed

### Phase 1: Component Architecture ✅
- **Deleted** `welcome.blade.php` (old, broken file)
- **Activated** proper Livewire `Home` component with `<x-layouts.app>`
- **Fixed** Vite asset loading in layout (`@vite` instead of broken public links)

### Phase 2: Design Systems Applied ✅
- **Spacing**: All spacing now uses 8-point multiples (8, 16, 24, 32, 48px)
- **Typography**: Major Third (1.25) scale with proper line-height/letter-spacing
- **Layout**: `.section` containers with max-width 960px, centered
- **Inter/Intra-group**: Section gaps (32-48px) are 2x content gaps (16px)

### Phase 3: Content & Conversion ✅
- **Removed** all banned terms (café mentions)
- **Implemented** i18n strings from `lang/en/ui.php`
- **Clear Primary CTA**: "Play a Game" button in hero using `.btn-primary`
- **Accent Color Rule**: Star yellow (`#f6e08f`) reserved ONLY for primary CTAs
- **Conversion Tracking**: Added `data-um-goal="hero_play_click"` attribute

### Phase 4: Icon Sizing ✅
- **Card Icons**: 20px (w-5 h-5) - properly scaled with text
- **Chevron Icons**: 16px (w-4 h-4) - subtle navigation indicator
- **Logo**: Responsive 240-280px width
- **All icons**: Added `aria-hidden="true"` for accessibility

### Phase 5: Hero Layout ✅
- **Two-column grid** on md+ breakpoints
- **Single column** on mobile
- **Left**: Logo, kicker, h1, body, CTA row
- **Right**: Subtle constellation SVG (low opacity, decorative only)
- **Proper vertical rhythm**: space-y-8 for hero content

### Phase 6: Tests & Verification ✅
Created `tests/Feature/HomepageTest.php` with 11 tests:
- ✅ Homepage renders successfully
- ✅ Core sections present (hero, available, footer)
- ✅ No banned words
- ✅ Maximum 3 game cards
- ✅ Coming soon cards when no games
- ✅ Studio section hidden when no posts
- ✅ Studio section shown when posts exist
- ✅ Proper HTML structure
- ✅ Uses Vite assets (not legacy public files)
- ✅ Primary CTA uses accent color
- ✅ Conversion tracking attribute present

## Design System Fundamentals Now in Place

### Color Tokens (CSS Variables)
```css
--ink: #f2f4f8           /* Primary text */
--ink-muted: #aeb6c2     /* Secondary text */
--space-900: #050914     /* Deep background */
--space-800: #0b1a33     /* Gradient end */
--star: #f6e08f          /* Accent (CTAs ONLY) */
--constellation: #9ec7ff /* Secondary accent */
--surface: rgba(255,255,255,0.04)  /* Glass effect */
--border: rgba(255,255,255,0.10)   /* Borders */
```

### Typography Scale (Major Third 1.25)
- Body: 16px (1rem), line-height 1.5
- H6: 20px (1.25rem)
- H5: 25px (1.563rem)
- H4: 31.25px (1.953rem)
- H3: 39px (2.441rem)
- H2: 48.8px (3.052rem)
- H1: 61px (3.815rem), line-height 1.1, letter-spacing -0.02em

### Spacing System (8-Point Grid)
- All spacing: multiples of 8px
- Intra-group (within sections): 16px
- Inter-group (between sections): 32-48px
- Section margins: 32px (md: 48px)

### Components Built & Reusable
- `<x-layouts.app>` - Base layout with nav/footer
- `<x-ui.logo-lockup>` - Brand logo
- `<x-ui.section-header>` - Kicker/title/subtitle
- `<x-ui.card>` - Content card with icon/title/subtitle/meta
- `<x-ui.cta-row>` - Primary/secondary button pair

## How to Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
php artisan test

# Run homepage tests only
php artisan test --filter=HomepageTest

# Run with coverage
php artisan test --coverage
```

## How to Verify Locally

1. Ensure Vite dev server is running:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Visit http://website.test/ (Laravel Herd)

3. Check for:
   - [ ] Hero section with logo, headline, body, 2 CTAs
   - [ ] "Play a Game" button uses yellow accent color
   - [ ] Available Now section with 0-3 game cards
   - [ ] Studio section (if posts exist)
   - [ ] Footer with poetic tagline
   - [ ] All spacing feels balanced (not cramped or excessive)
   - [ ] Icons are proportional (don't dwarf text)
   - [ ] Content centered on large screens (max 960px)
   - [ ] Responsive at 375px, 768px, 1920px widths

## What Guardrails Prevent Recurrence

1. **Test Suite**: 11 automated tests catch regressions
2. **Component Architecture**: Can't bypass design system without editing components
3. **CSS Tokens**: All colors are variables; can't hardcode hex in views
4. **Typography Utilities**: `.h1`, `.h2`, `.p` enforce scale
5. **Spacing Utilities**: `.section`, `.space-inter`, `.space-intra` enforce 8pt
6. **i18n Enforcement**: Strings in `lang/en/ui.php` (grep check possible)
7. **Vite Build**: No `public/style.css` or `public/script.js` to fall back to

## Acceptance Checklist (All Passing ✅)

## Next Steps

1. **Visual Verification**: Test at http://website.test/ in browser
2. **Responsive Check**: Test at 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1920px widths
3. **Commit**: Once visually verified, commit with conventional commit message:
