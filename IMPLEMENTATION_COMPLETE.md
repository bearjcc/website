# Ursa Minor - Implementation Complete âœ“

## Summary

A complete Laravel 11 + TALL stack application has been successfully built for Ursa Minor. The application features a dark "Starlight" design system, role-based access control, and a fully functional public/private content architecture.

## What Was Built

### Core Infrastructure âœ“

- **Laravel 11** with PHP 8.3
- **Livewire 3** for reactive components
