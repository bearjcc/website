## Testing

### Running Tests

Run all tests:
```powershell
php artisan test
```

Run specific test file:
```powershell
php artisan test --filter=HomePageTest
```

Run tests with coverage:
```powershell
php artisan test --coverage
```

### Test Coverage

The project follows **humility protocol** - no changes should be merged without verification through tests.

**Homepage Tests** (`tests/Feature/HomePageTest.php`):
- âœ… Core sections render correctly
- âœ… No banned future-facing terms (cafÃ©, storefront, etc.)
- âœ… Game cards limited to three
- âœ… Hero section with primary CTA
- âœ… Footer and navigation present

### Future Testing Goals

**Planned enhancements:**
- Browser testing with Laravel Dusk or Cypress for visual regression detection
- Static analysis to detect inline hex colors in views
- Performance testing for page load times
- Accessibility testing (WCAG AA compliance)

**Target:** 80%+ code coverage for all new features
