## Testing

### Running Tests

Run all tests:
```powershell
php artisan test
```

Run specific test file:
```powershell
php artisan test --filter=HomePageTest
```

Run tests with coverage:
```powershell
php artisan test --coverage
```

### Test Coverage

The project follows **humility protocol** - no changes should be merged without verification through tests.

**Homepage Tests** (`tests/Feature/HomePageTest.php`):
- âœ… Core sections render correctly
- âœ… No banned future-facing terms (cafÃ©, storefront, etc.)
- âœ… Game cards limited to three
- âœ… Hero section with primary CTA
- âœ… Footer and navigation present

### Future Testing Goals

**Planned enhancements:**
- Browser testing with Laravel Dusk or Cypress for visual regression detection
- Static analysis to detect inline hex colors in views
- Performance testing for page load times
- Accessibility testing (WCAG AA compliance)

**Target:** 80%+ code coverage for all new features

## Deployment

### Deploying to Railway with Docker

This project uses a production-ready multi-stage Docker build for Railway deployments.

**Prerequisites:**
- Railway project linked to this GitHub repository
- Railway configured to use Dockerfile (not nixpacks)

**Required Railway Environment Variables:**
```env
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_KEY=<generated-on-first-deploy>
APP_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app
LOG_CHANNEL=stderr
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Database (if using Railway Postgres)
DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
# Or use individual variables:
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=${{Postgres.PGHOST}}
DB_PORT=${{Postgres.PGPORT}}
DB_DATABASE=${{Postgres.PGDATABASE}}
DB_USERNAME=${{Postgres.PGUSER}}
DB_PASSWORD=${{Postgres.PGPASSWORD}}

# Optional: Auto-run migrations
RUN_MIGRATIONS=1
```

**Deployment Process:**
1. Push to `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions runs smoke test (Docker build validation)
3. Railway detects Dockerfile and builds multi-stage image
4. App starts with nginx + php-fpm via supervisord
5. Site goes live on port 8080

**Railway Configuration:**
- **Builder**: Dockerfile
- **Port**: 8080 (automatically detected)
- **Health Check**: `/up` (optional)
- **Start Command**: Handled by Dockerfile CMD

**What the Docker Build Does:**
1. **Stage 1**: Builds frontend assets with npm (Vite)
2. **Stage 2**: Installs PHP dependencies with Composer (--no-dev)
3. **Stage 3**: Combines everything into PHP-FPM + Nginx runtime
4. **On Start**: Generates APP_KEY if missing, caches config/routes/views, runs migrations if enabled

**Logs:**
All logs go to stderr/stdout for Railway dashboard visibility. Set `LOG_CHANNEL=stderr` in Railway env vars.

**Troubleshooting:**
- Build fails? Check GitHub Actions smoke test results
- 500 errors? Check Railway logs for missing APP_KEY or DB issues
- Assets missing? Verify `public/build/` exists in built image
- DB errors? Ensure Postgres plugin is added and variables are set
