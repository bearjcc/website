## Notes

### Why Livewire Before Tailwind?
Livewire installation is simpler and doesn't require Node.js. It provides immediate value for future reactive components while we can use vanilla CSS for now.

### Node.js Installation
User needs to:
1. Download from nodejs.org
2. Install LTS version
3. Restart terminal/IDE
4. Run `npm install` in project
5. Continue with Tailwind setup

### Maintaining Momentum
The "baby steps" approach is working well:
- Small, focused commits
- Feature branch for related changes
- Clear documentation
- Incremental improvements
