## Overview

**URL**: http://tavernsandtreasures.test/ (local)  
**Production**: Railway auto-deploy  
**Phase**: 1 Complete, 2 In Progress

---

## What's Working ✅

### Foundation (Phase 1)
- Homepage with night sky theme
- Visual-first game card system
- Embla carousel with constellation pagination
- Horizon footer with back-to-top
- Page-height starfield animation
- Nav logo morph
- Responsive design (laptop/tablet first)
- HSL color system with derived tokens
- Major Third typography scale (1.25 ratio)
- 8-point spacing grid
- Lowercase mode feature flag
- Component architecture (14 reusable components)
- Railway deployment with Docker multi-stage build
- 33 tests passing (100% success rate)

### Games (Phase 2)
**6 games functional**:
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Connect 4
- Sudoku
- Minesweeper

- 2048

All use visual-first cards with motif-based recognition.

## Documentation Structure ✅

Consolidated to **3 core MD files + 5 technical guides + AI rules**:

**Core** (human-readable):
1. `README.md` — Project overview
2. `DESIGN_BIBLE.md` — Complete design reference
3. `docs/TODO.md` — Tasks + roadmap

**Technical Guides** (when needed):
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/FEATURE_EXTRACTION_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
- `docs/FLUX_INTEGRATION.md`
- `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`

**AI Rules** (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`):
- 16 MDC files for automated agent guidance
- Properly scoped with globs
- Component patterns, testing guardrails, minimal copy philosophy

**Reduction**: 18 docs → 10 files, cut 3,779 lines of redundancy

## Game UI Cleanup ✅ COMPLETE

All 6 games now aligned with DESIGN_BIBLE:
- ✅ All emoji removed (replaced with Heroicons)
- ✅ 1,000+ lines of inline CSS extracted to `app.css`
- ✅ All colors converted to HSL tokens
- ✅ Constellation-style completion messages added
- ✅ Standardized controls (`.control-btn` with icons + text)
- ✅ Proper aria-labels throughout
- ✅ 44px minimum touch targets
- ✅ `prefers-reduced-motion` respected

### Code Reduction
**Before**: 1,150 lines of inline styles across 4 games  
**After**: Organized in `app.css` with proper HSL tokens  
**Net**: -576 lines from game views

### Missing Games
- Chess (in database, not yet implemented)
- Checkers (in database, not yet implemented)

## Next Step Options

### Option A: Complete Phase 2 (Implement Missing Games)
- [ ] Implement Chess
- [ ] Implement Checkers
- [ ] Polish games lobby further
- [ ] Add score tracking system
- [ ] High score leaderboards

### Option B: Move to Phase 3 (F1 Predictions)
6 solid, polished games sufficient. Extract F1 system from `C:\Users\bearj\Herd\formula1predictions`

### Option C: Polish Current Games
- [ ] Game-specific loading animations (starfield motif)
- [ ] localStorage save state
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Accessibility audit with real screen readers

**Recommendation**: Option B — foundation is solid, 6 games working well, time to build community features (F1 Predictions)

## Technical Health

### Tests
- 33 tests, 51 assertions, 100% passing
- Homepage thoroughly tested
- Game cards tested
- Minimal copy validated
- Visual assertions working

### Code Quality
- Laravel Pint: Clean
- No linter errors
- Follows PSR-12
- Type declarations throughout

### Deployment

**All 69 tests passing.**

**Decision point**: Implement 2 more games (Chess/Checkers), or move to Phase 3 (F1 Predictions)?
