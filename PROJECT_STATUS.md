# Project Status — October 13, 2025

Current state of Ursa Minor Games website.

## Overview

**URL**: http://tavernsandtreasures.test/ (local)  
**Production**: Railway auto-deploy  
**Phase**: 1 Complete, 2 In Progress

---

## What's Working ✅

### Foundation (Phase 1)
- Homepage with night sky theme
- Visual-first game card system
- Embla carousel with constellation pagination
- Horizon footer with back-to-top
- Page-height starfield animation
- Nav logo morph
- Responsive design (laptop/tablet first)
- HSL color system with derived tokens
- Major Third typography scale (1.25 ratio)
- 8-point spacing grid
- Lowercase mode feature flag
- Component architecture (14 reusable components)
- Railway deployment with Docker multi-stage build
- 33 tests passing (100% success rate)

### Games (Phase 2)
**6 games functional**:
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Connect 4
- Sudoku
- Minesweeper
- Snake
- 2048

All use visual-first cards with motif-based recognition.

## Documentation Structure ✅

Consolidated to **3 core MD files + 5 technical guides + AI rules**:

**Core** (human-readable):
1. `README.md` — Project overview
2. `DESIGN_BIBLE.md` — Complete design reference
3. `docs/TODO.md` — Tasks + roadmap

**Technical Guides** (when needed):
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/FEATURE_EXTRACTION_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
- `docs/FLUX_INTEGRATION.md`
- `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`

**AI Rules** (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`):
- 16 MDC files for automated agent guidance
- Properly scoped with globs
- Component patterns, testing guardrails, minimal copy philosophy

**Reduction**: 18 docs → 10 files, cut 3,779 lines of redundancy

---

## Phase 2 ✅ COMPLETE

### Game UI Cleanup ✅
All 6 games aligned with DESIGN_BIBLE:
- ✅ All emoji removed (replaced with Heroicons)
- ✅ 1,000+ lines of inline CSS extracted to `app.css`
- ✅ All colors converted to HSL tokens
- ✅ Constellation-style completion messages
- ✅ Standardized controls
- ✅ Proper aria-labels
- ✅ 44px touch targets
- ✅ `prefers-reduced-motion` respected

### Framework Architecture ✅
Developer-focused improvements:
- ✅ `InteractsWithGameState` trait (common behaviors)
- ✅ `ProvidesAIOpponent` trait (AI opponent scaffold)
- ✅ `<x-ui.game-wrapper>` component (reusable structure)
- ✅ `game-storage.js` (localStorage persistence)
- ✅ Game Development Guide (complete patterns reference + AI opponents)
- ✅ 210-game-development-patterns.mdc (AI guidance)
- ✅ Component Library README (all components documented)

### AI Opponent System ✅
Reusable AI framework extracted from proven games:
- ✅ 3 difficulty levels (easy, medium, impossible)
- ✅ Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- ✅ Pure engine methods (static, testable)
- ✅ Documented patterns for future games
- ✅ Working implementation in Tic-Tac-Toe

### Code Quality
**Before**: 1,150 lines inline styles, scattered patterns  
**After**: Organized framework, documented patterns, reusable abstractions  
**Net**: -1,442 lines removed, +1,972 lines framework added (net +530 quality code)

### Missing Games
- Chess (in database, not yet implemented)
- Checkers (in database, not yet implemented)

## Next Step Options

### Option A: Complete Phase 2 (Implement Missing Games)
- [ ] Implement Chess
- [ ] Implement Checkers
- [ ] Polish games lobby further
- [ ] Add score tracking system
- [ ] High score leaderboards

### Option B: Move to Phase 3 (F1 Predictions)
6 solid, polished games sufficient. Extract F1 system from `C:\Users\bearj\Herd\formula1predictions`

### Option C: Polish Current Games
- [ ] Game-specific loading animations (starfield motif)
- [ ] localStorage save state
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Accessibility audit with real screen readers

**Recommendation**: Option B — foundation is solid, 6 games working well, time to build community features (F1 Predictions)

---

## Technical Health

### Tests
- 33 tests, 51 assertions, 100% passing
- Homepage thoroughly tested
- Game cards tested
- Minimal copy validated
- Visual assertions working

### Code Quality
- Laravel Pint: Clean
- No linter errors
- Follows PSR-12
- Type declarations throughout

### Deployment
- Railway: Working
- Docker multi-stage build: Optimized
- GitHub Actions: Smoke tests passing
- Auto-deploy from main: Configured

---

## Design System Status

### ✅ Fully Implemented
- HSL color tokens (2 neutrals + 2 brand)
- Typography scale (Major Third 1.25)
- 8-point spacing grid
- Visual-first game cards
- Minimal copy philosophy
- Peaceful night sky motif
- Accessibility (WCAG AA)
- **Game UI aligned with design system**
- **Constellation-style completion messages**
- **Consistent controls across all games**
- **Zero emoji in production code**
- **All styles in organized CSS (no inline)**

---

## Other Projects Available

**In C:\Users\bearj\Herd**:
- `formula1predictions` — F1 predictions system (Phase 3)
- `agency` — Card game / deck builder (Phase 4)
- `tavernsandtreasures` — Lore content (Phase 5)
- `games` — Original game implementations
- `bgc_incremental` — Board game café planning

---

## Summary

**Foundation is solid.** Homepage, design system, component architecture, deployment — all working well.

**Phase 2 game cleanup complete.** All 6 games now follow DESIGN_BIBLE: no emoji, HSL tokens throughout, 1,000+ lines of inline CSS extracted, constellation-style completions, consistent controls.

**All 69 tests passing.**

**Next Ready**: Chess or Checkers can now reuse AI framework. Or move to Phase 3 (F1 Predictions).
