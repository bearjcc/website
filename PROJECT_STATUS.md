## Overview

**URL**: http://tavernsandtreasures.test/ (local)  
**Production**: Railway auto-deploy  
**Phase**: 1 Complete, 2 In Progress

## What's Working ‚úÖ

### Foundation (Phase 1)
- Homepage with night sky theme
- Visual-first game card system
- Embla carousel with constellation pagination

- Page-height starfield animation
- Nav logo morph
- Responsive design (laptop/tablet first)
- HSL color system with derived tokens
- Major Third typography scale (1.25 ratio)
- 8-point spacing grid
- Lowercase mode feature flag
- Component architecture (14 reusable components)
- Railway deployment with Docker multi-stage build
- 33 tests passing (100% success rate)

### Games (Phase 2)
**6 games functional**:
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Connect 4
- Sudoku
- Minesweeper
- Snake
- 2048

All use visual-first cards with motif-based recognition.

## Documentation Structure ‚úÖ

Consolidated to **3 core MD files + 5 technical guides + AI rules**:

**Core** (human-readable):
1. `README.md` ‚Äî Project overview
2. `DESIGN_BIBLE.md` ‚Äî Complete design reference
3. `docs/TODO.md` ‚Äî Tasks + roadmap

**Technical Guides** (when needed):
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/FEATURE_EXTRACTION_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
- `docs/FLUX_INTEGRATION.md`
- `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`

**AI Rules** (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`):
- 16 MDC files for automated agent guidance
- Properly scoped with globs
- Component patterns, testing guardrails, minimal copy philosophy

**Reduction**: 18 docs ‚Üí 10 files, cut 3,779 lines of redundancy

## What Needs Work üéØ

### Immediate (Game UI Cleanup)

**Alignment with DESIGN_BIBLE**:
1. Remove emoji from game controls (violates no-emoji rule)
2. Extract inline `<style>` blocks to `app.css`
3. Replace hardcoded hex/rgba with HSL tokens
4. Apply night sky motif to game states (loading, completion, progress)
5. Standardize game controls across all 6 games

**Specific Issues Found**:
- Sudoku uses emoji: üîÑ (new game), üí° (hint), üóëÔ∏è (clear), ‚úèÔ∏è (notes)
- Games have 400+ lines of inline CSS
- Some colors still use `rgba()` instead of HSL tokens
- Completion states don't use constellation/star motif
- Loading states missing gentle star animation

### Missing Features
- Chess (in database, not implemented)
- Checkers (in database, not implemented)

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Polish Sudoku (Reference Implementation)
Use as template for other games:
- Replace emoji with Heroicons
- Extract styles to CSS  
- Apply HSL tokens
- Add starfield loading state
- Add constellation completion animation
- Test thoroughly

### 2. Apply Pattern to Other 5 Games
Replicate Sudoku cleanup for:
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Connect 4
- Minesweeper
- Snake
- 2048

### 3. Implement Missing Games
- Chess
- Checkers

### 4. Complete Phase 2
- Polish games lobby
- Add score tracking (if desired)
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility audit

---

## Technical Health

### Tests
- 33 tests, 51 assertions, 100% passing
- Homepage thoroughly tested
- Game cards tested
- Minimal copy validated
- Visual assertions working

### Code Quality
- Laravel Pint: Clean
- No linter errors
- Follows PSR-12
- Type declarations throughout

### Deployment
- Railway: Working
- Docker multi-stage build: Optimized
- GitHub Actions: Smoke tests passing
- Auto-deploy from main: Configured

---

## Design System Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented
- HSL color tokens (2 neutrals + 2 brand)
- Typography scale (Major Third 1.25)
- 8-point spacing grid
- Visual-first game cards
- Minimal copy philosophy
- Peaceful night sky motif
- Accessibility (WCAG AA)

### üéØ Needs Application
- Night sky motif in game UI
- Constellation progress indicators
- Star-based loading states
- Consistent game control styling
