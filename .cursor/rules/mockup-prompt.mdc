# Ursa Minor Mockup Task — Checklist and Prompt

This rule holds the **checklist** (single source of truth). When working in `docs/mockups/`, the mockup-task rule also applies; update the checklist here when you complete an item.

---

## What you are doing

**Wireframe and mock up the game experience** for Ursa Minor Games. Produce one page or mockup per task. Each deliverable must be a static HTML wireframe (and optionally a short layout ASCII) that defines structure, content blocks, and one clear next action. Do not implement backend or Livewire — layout and UX only.

---

## Why

- **Design clarity** — Stakeholders and implementers see the target before build.
- **Template for implementation** — Each mockup is the reference for the corresponding Blade/Livewire view.
- **Alignment with the design system** — Ensures every screen fits the "peaceful night sky" philosophy (see DESIGN_BIBLE.md and project rules).

---

## What we are looking to accomplish (this run)

**Your job:** Find the **first unchecked item** in the checklist below. Complete it. Then mark it as checked in this document (and in `docs/mockups/TODO.md` if that file exists in your workspace, so both stay in sync).

- **Deliverables per item:**
  - A short layout ASCII (e.g. `docs/mockups/ursa-minor-<name>-layout-ascii.txt`) to help you clarify structure and identify regions of the page.
  - One HTML mockup file in the mockups folder (e.g. `docs/mockups/ursa-minor-<name>-mockup.html`).
- **Style:** Match existing Ursa Minor mockups: wireframe look (dashed borders, gray blocks, placeholders), same header/footer chrome, max-width centered main, one primary CTA. Use `ursa-minor-homepage-mockup.html`, `ursa-minor-play-mockup.html`, and `ursa-minor-game-page-mockup.html` as references. Use the same header nav as existing mockups (Logo → `index.html`, Home → `ursa-minor-homepage-mockup.html`, Games → `ursa-minor-play-mockup.html`, All wireframes → `index.html`) so wireframes stay navigable.

---

## What to focus on

- **Layout and structure** — Header, main content, footer; placement of hero, CTA, rules, navigation.
- **One clear next action** — One primary button/link (e.g. "Play") so the user's next step is obvious.
- **Consistency** — Same header (logo, Home, Games, About), same footer (horizon style), same button/chrome patterns as existing mockups.
- **Game experience only** — Pre-play (entry) and play (board/controls) screens; no auth flows, no account pages, no marketing pages.
- **Design Bible** — Calm, no noise; "peaceful night sky." No value strips, app badges, or extra CTAs unless specified.

---

## What not to focus on

- **Backend or framework** — No Laravel, Livewire, or database; static HTML/CSS only.
- **Copy or content** — Placeholder text and labels are enough; no need for final marketing copy.
- **Visual polish** — Wireframe-level is fine (gray blocks, dashed borders); no full visual design or assets.
- **Pages out of scope** — No game-not-found (404) until that item is in the list; no per-game play mockups until you're on that item. Do only the **first unchecked** item.

---
