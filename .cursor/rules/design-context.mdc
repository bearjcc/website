# Design context — Ursa Minor

When editing views, CSS, or design-related docs:

1. **Read** @DESIGN_BIBLE.md for the full design reference: peaceful night sky philosophy, colors (HSL), typography, layout, tone, accessibility.
2. **Apply** the decision filter: Does this feel like peaceful night sky? Does it belong like a star in a constellation, or is it noise? Is it calm, collected, and welcoming? If no to any, do not add it.
3. **Avoid** purple gradients, value strips, app badges, marketing hype, and anything that demands attention. Craigslist-like simplicity; understated, never overstated.

Reference the file; do not duplicate long excerpts in this rule.
