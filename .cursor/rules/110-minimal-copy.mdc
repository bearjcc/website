# Minimal Copy Philosophy

Guidelines for implementing the "less is more" content philosophy across the Ursa Minor site.

## Core Principle

**"Sometimes less is more"**

The site embraces restraint and visual clarity. Every word must earn its place. No filler text, no verbose explanations, no marketing hype. Just peaceful, confident, welcoming presence.

## Critical Rules

1. **HERO SECTION**: Logo + tagline only. No headline, no body text
2. **CTA LABELS**: One word only ("Play", "Browse", "Learn")
3. **SECTION HEADERS**: Avoid verbose kickers and subtitles
4. **GAME CARDS**: Visual-first, titles reveal on hover
5. **FOOTER**: Just copyright line, no mottos
6. **NAVIGATION**: Single-word labels

## Tone Guidelines

**Design and copy must be**:
- Calm, collected, reserved
- Welcoming, peaceful, humble
- Stated clearly (not shy, anxious, or nervous)
- Never spiritual, never hype, never apologetic

**Think of it as**: The peaceful feeling of looking at the night sky after sunset. Just there, quietly, confidently. No demands, no noise.

## Hero Section Rules

### Maximum Content

```blade
{{-- ✅ CORRECT - Minimal hero --}}
<section class="hero">
    <x-ui.logo-lockup />
    <p>{{ __('ui.tagline') }}</p>  {{-- One short phrase only --}}
    <x-ui.flux-button>{{ __('ui.cta_play') }}</x-ui.flux-button>
</section>

{{-- ❌ WRONG - Too verbose --}}
<section class="hero">
    <h1>Small games. Big craft. Amazing adventures.</h1>
    <p>We're a small indie studio building incredible gaming experiences...</p>
    <p>Join us on our journey as we create...</p>
    <button>Start Playing Amazing Games Now!</button>
</section>
```

### Tagline Guidelines

- Maximum 6 words
- No marketing speak
- Peaceful and stated
- Examples:
  - ✅ "The sky is the limit."
  - ✅ "Little Bear. Big craft."
  - ❌ "The Ultimate Gaming Experience Awaits!"
  - ❌ "Join Our Amazing Community Today!"

## CTA (Call-to-Action) Rules

### One-Word Labels

**DO**:
- Play
- Browse
- Learn
- Explore
- Start

**DON'T**:
- "Start Playing Now!"
- "Browse All Games"
- "Learn More About Us"
- "Get Started Today"

### Accessibility

While visible text is minimal, provide full context via ARIA:

```blade
<x-ui.flux-button 
    variant="primary"
    aria-label="Play browser games"
>
    Play
</x-ui.flux-button>
```

## Section Headers

### Avoid Verbose Headers

```blade
{{-- ✅ CORRECT - No section header at all, or ultra-minimal --}}
<section>
    <x-ui.carousel>
        {{-- Games directly --}}
    </x-ui.carousel>
</section>

{{-- ❌ WRONG - Verbose kickers and subtitles --}}
<x-ui.section-header
    kicker="Available now"
    title="Play in your browser"
    subtitle="No sign-up required. Works great on laptops and large tablets."
/>
```

### When Headers Are Needed

If a section absolutely needs a header (for structure or clarity):
- Keep it to a simple H2 with 2-4 words
- No kicker text
- No subtitle/body text

```blade
{{-- Acceptable when needed --}}
<h2>Latest Notes</h2>
```

## Visual-First Game Cards

### Implementation

Game cards should rely on visual motifs, not text labels:

```blade
<x-ui.game-card
    :href="route('games.play', $game->slug)"
    :title="$game->title"
    :motif="'tictactoe'"
    {{-- Title appears only on hover/focus --}}
    {{-- Accessibility via aria-label="Play Tic-Tac-Toe" --}}
/>
```

### Content Rules

- No visible title by default
- Visual motif communicates game type
- Title in `<h3 class="sr-only">` for accessibility
- Title reveals on hover/focus in translucent pill
- Entire card is clickable immediately (no wait for animation)

## Footer Rules

### Minimal Footer Content

**Current standard**: Just copyright line

```blade
<footer class="um-horizon-footer">
    {{-- Horizon line and silhouette (visual elements) --}}
    {{-- Back to top button --}}
    <p>&copy; {{ now()->year }} Ursa Minor Games</p>
    {{-- Future: Privacy | Attributions (when needed) --}}
</footer>
```

**DON'T**:
- No mottos or taglines in footer
- No random poetic phrases
- No "All rights reserved" (implied by copyright)
- Keep for future: Privacy, Attributions links when needed

## Navigation Rules

### Single-Word Labels

```blade
{{-- ✅ CORRECT --}}
<nav>
    <a href="/">Home</a>
    <a href="/games">Games</a>
    <a href="/about">About</a>
</nav>

{{-- ❌ WRONG --}}
<nav>
    <a href="/">Back to Homepage</a>
    <a href="/games">Browse All Games</a>
    <a href="/about">Learn About Us</a>
</nav>
```

## Content Guidelines by Page Type

### Homepage
- Logo lockup
- One tagline (max 6 words)
- Two CTAs (one word each)
- Visual-first game carousel
- Minimal footer

### Games Index
- Optional: Simple heading ("Games" or no header at all)
- Visual-first card grid
- No introductory paragraphs

### Game Detail Pages
- Game title
- Minimal rules (collapsible or very brief)
- Play area
- Minimal controls

### About Page
- This is the ONE place where slightly more copy is acceptable
- Still keep it concise and structured
- Focus on current state, not future promises

## i18n String Organization

Keep `lang/en/ui.php` minimal and organized:

```php
return [
    // === Hero Section ===
    'tagline' => 'The sky is the limit.',
    'cta_play' => 'Play',
    'cta_browse' => 'Browse',

    // === Navigation ===
    'nav_games' => 'Games',
    'nav_about' => 'About',

    // === Accessibility ===
    'back_to_top' => 'Back to top',
];
```

**Remove**:
- Unused strings
- Duplicate entries
- Verbose section headers
- Body text strings that shouldn't exist

## Testing Guidelines

### Test for Minimalism

Tests should verify minimal copy is maintained:

```php
public function test_homepage_has_minimal_sections(): void
{
    $response = $this->get('/');
    $html = $response->getContent();

    // Should NOT have verbose section headers
    $this->assertStringNotContainsString('Available now', $html);
    $this->assertStringNotContainsString('Play in your browser', $html);
    
    // Should NOT have hero body text
    $this->assertStringNotContainsString('We build elegant', $html);
}
```

## Examples

### Good: Minimal Homepage

```blade
{{-- Hero: Just essentials --}}
<section>
    <x-ui.logo-lockup />
    <p>The sky is the limit.</p>
    <x-ui.flux-button variant="primary">Play</x-ui.flux-button>
    <x-ui.flux-button variant="secondary">Browse</x-ui.flux-button>
</section>

{{-- Games: Visual-first carousel --}}
<section>
    <x-ui.carousel>
        @foreach($games as $game)
            <x-ui.game-card :game="$game" />
        @endforeach
    </x-ui.carousel>
</section>

{{-- Footer: Just copyright --}}
<footer>
    <p>&copy; 2025 Ursa Minor Games</p>
</footer>
```

### Bad: Verbose Homepage

```blade
{{-- ❌ Too much copy --}}
<section class="hero">
    <h1>Welcome to Ursa Minor Games!</h1>
    <h2>Small games. Big craft. Amazing adventures.</h2>
    <p>We're a passionate indie game studio creating incredible...</p>
    <p>Join us on our journey as we build amazing experiences...</p>
    <button>Start Your Gaming Adventure Now!</button>
</section>

<section>
    <div>
        <span>AVAILABLE NOW</span>
        <h2>Play in your browser</h2>
        <p>No sign-up required. Works great on all devices. Start playing today!</p>
    </div>
    {{-- Verbose cards with descriptions --}}
</section>

<footer>
    <p>Building games under the stars with love and passion.</p>
    <p>The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.</p>
    <p>&copy; 2025 Ursa Minor Games. All rights reserved worldwide.</p>
</footer>
```

## Scrolling Discipline

**"How much people have to scroll = less is more"**

- Keep above-the-fold content focused
- Don't force scrolling to find essential actions
- Use vertical space wisely (generous but not excessive)
- Primary CTA should be visible without scrolling

## Reading Burden

**"How much they have to read = less is more"**

- Reduce cognitive load
- Let visuals communicate where possible
- Users should understand the page in seconds, not minutes
- Prefer icons, motifs, and visual hierarchy over text explanations

## Purpose of Every Element

**"Everything on the site should serve a purpose"**

Before adding any text:
1. Does this text serve a specific purpose?
2. Can a visual element communicate this instead?
3. Is this the minimum text needed?
4. Does removing this hurt clarity?

If you can't articulate the purpose, don't add the text.

## Exceptions

### About Page
More copy is acceptable here for:
- Mission explanation
- Background/history
- Contact information
- Long-term vision (brief mention)

### Help/Rules Pages
Game rules need enough copy to be clear, but:
- Keep instructions concise
- Use bullet points
- Prefer diagrams/examples over paragraphs

### Legal Pages (Future)
Privacy policy, terms, etc. will need standard legal copy.

## Questions?

When writing copy:
- Is this the minimum text needed?
- Can a visual replace this?
- Is this calm and welcoming, not hype?
- Does every word serve a purpose?

**If in doubt, use less.**
