# Verification guide — Ursa Minor

Use this as a **guide for what to verify**. Not a task list; reference when preparing to commit or when building a game.

- Pint has been run: `./vendor/bin/pint`
- No linter errors
- No emoji in production code
- No secrets committed
- Commit message is descriptive (conventional commits)

## Game development (when building a game)

### Code quality

- No side effects in engine
- Clear PHPDoc comments

### Reusability

- Uses `InteractsWithGameState` trait
- Uses `<x-ui.game-wrapper>` component
- Standard control buttons with Heroicons
- Constellation-style completion message
- HSL color tokens (no hardcoded colors)

### Testability

- Unit tests for engine methods
- Feature tests for Livewire component
- Tests cover edge cases
- Tests for win conditions
- Tests for invalid moves

### Accessibility

- Proper aria-labels
- Keyboard navigation (where applicable)
- 44px minimum touch targets
- Focus states visible
- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected

### Night sky theme
