                Ursa Minor is a game development brand focused on creating memorable gaming experiences—from classic 
                browser games to innovative board games and beyond. We believe great games start with great ideas, 
                careful planning, and a community of passionate players.

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>
                One day, we dream of opening a board game café in New Zealand—a place where friends gather, 
                strategies unfold, and new adventures begin. But every great journey starts with a single step.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before that dream becomes reality, we're building something special: a platform where we can 
                test game mechanics, explore world-building, share original board game designs, and create a 
                community around the love of gaming.
