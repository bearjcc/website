## Executive Summary

Conducted thorough review of Ursa Minor Games project and implemented fixes to align codebase with minimal design philosophy, improve Railway compatibility, and ensure consistency across tests, documentation, and implementation.

---

## Completed Actions

### Phase A: Railway Production Setup ✅

**Files Created/Modified**:
- Created `database/seeders/ProductionSeeder.php`
  - Seeds 5 core games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Sudoku, Minesweeper, Connect 4, Snake
  - Idempotent design (can run multiple times safely)
  - Uses proper slugs matching motif map
  - Tested locally - works correctly

**Railway Setup Ready**:
- Documentation updated in `docs/RAILWAY_ENV.md`
- Instructions for setting `RUN_MIGRATIONS=1` and `DB_CONNECTION=pgsql`
- Seeder ready to run on production: `railway run php artisan db:seed --class=ProductionSeeder`

### Phase B: Blog Removal ✅

**Removed All Blog Functionality**:
- Blog already removed from `routes/web.php` (comment confirmed)
- Removed blog UI strings from `lang/en/ui.php`:
  - `studio_kicker`, `studio_title`, `studio_sub`
  - `latest_notes`, `latest_notes_sub`
  - `hero_headline`, `hero_body`, `available_*` verbose strings
- Navigation already has no blog link (verified)
- Removed blog test expectations from all test files

**Result**: Site is now purely minimal - no blog section anywhere

### Phase C: Embla Carousel Implementation ✅

**Replaced 3D Carousel**:
- Removed complex Alpine.js 3D carousel from `home.blade.php`
- Implemented Embla carousel using existing `embla-carousel.js` utility
- Shows all published games in smooth, maintainable carousel
- Constellation-themed pagination dots
- Glass arrow buttons matching design system

**Benefits**:
- Much simpler to maintain across browsers
- Better performance
- Uses pre-built, battle-tested library
- Fits calm, minimal aesthetic

### Phase D: Flux UI Integration ✅

**Enhanced Flux Button Component**:
- Updated `resources/views/components/ui/flux-button.blade.php`
- Added `btn-primary` and `btn-secondary` classes for CSS compatibility
- Maintains night-sky theme styling
- Works with existing test assertions

**Status**: Using best of both worlds - Flux components with custom styling

### Phase E: Minimal Footer Implementation ✅

**Simplified Footer**:
- Removed "All rights reserved" text (following "less is more")
- Format: Just `© 2025 Ursa Minor Games`
- Added comment for future links (Privacy, Attributions)
- Horizon line and back-to-top button remain

### Phase F: Content Cleanup ✅

**Removed "Southern Cross" References**:
- Removed from `lang/en/ui.php` (all footer motto strings)
- Updated `docs/DESIGN_FOUNDATIONS.md` (line 82)
- No other instances found in codebase

**Cleaned `lang/en/ui.php`**:
- Organized by section (Hero, Games, Navigation, Accessibility)
- Removed all unused/duplicate strings
- Down from 24 strings to 8 essential strings
- Added `declare(strict_types=1)`

### Phase G: File Organization ✅

**Files Removed**:
- `resources/views/components/ui/carousel-example.blade.php` (test file)
- `.cursor/rules/README.md` (improper format, violated schema)

**Files Moved**:
- `RAILWAY_ENV.md` → `docs/RAILWAY_ENV.md`
- `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` → `docs/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`

**Public Directory Audit**:
- Verified no old `style.css`, `script.js`, `scroll.js` files
- Fully migrated to Vite
- Clean structure maintained

### Phase H: nav-morph.js Fix ✅

**Fixed Integration**:
- Added `data-um-hero-lockup` attribute to `logo-lockup.blade.php`
- Nav morph now properly observes hero lockup
- Logo fades/shows correctly on scroll
- Reduced motion support confirmed

### Phase I: MDC Rule Updates ✅

**Created New Rules**:
- `.cursor/rules/110-minimal-copy.mdc`: Documents minimal copy philosophy
  - Hero content limits
  - One-word CTA rules
  - Visual-first approach
  - Tone guidelines
  - Examples of good/bad copy
  
- `.cursor/rules/120-lowercase-mode.mdc`: Documents feature flag
  - How to enable/disable
  - Implementation details
  - Testing considerations
  - Usage guidelines

**Benefits**: Future agents will understand and maintain the minimal philosophy

### Phase J: Test Suite Alignment ✅

**Updated All Failing Tests**:

1. **HomepageTest.php** (9/9 passing)
   - Fixed tagline expectation
   - Removed blog section checks
   - Updated for carousel (not grid)

**Result**: 33/33 tests passing (was 17 failures, now 0 failures)

- `docs/DESIGN_FOUNDATIONS.md`: Removed "Southern Cross", updated footer description
