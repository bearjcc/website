# Ursa Minor Games - Setup Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Documentation organized, Railway deployment fixed

---

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### Phase 0: Emergency Fixes
- **✅ Railway Deployment Issue Identified and Fixed**
  - **Problem**: Railway build was failing because `nixpacks.toml` didn't include Node.js
  - **Root Cause**: The `package.json` includes Vite and Tailwind CSS dependencies that need Node.js to build, but the Railway configuration only had PHP
  - **Solution**: Updated `nixpacks.toml` to include Node.js 20 and npm install/build steps
  - **Status**: Fix committed and pushed to main branch - Railway should now deploy successfully

### Documentation Organization
- **✅ Created comprehensive Master Roadmap** (`docs/MASTER_ROADMAP.md`)
  - Complete project vision from concept to board game café
  - 7 phases with detailed breakdowns
  - Timeline: 48 weeks to full platform
  - Success metrics and milestones
  - Risk management and decision log

- **✅ Created Feature Extraction Guide** (`docs/FEATURE_EXTRACTION_GUIDE.md`)
  - Step-by-step guides for extracting features from existing repos
  - Repository-specific instructions for:
    - formula1predictions (F1 system)
    - games (25+ browser games)
    - tavernsandtreasures (world-building wiki)
    - agency (board game platform)
  - Common integration patterns
  - Troubleshooting guide

- **✅ Created Documentation Index** (`docs/INDEX.md`)
  - Central hub for all documentation
  - Quick reference guide
  - File location map
  - External resources

- **✅ Created TODO List** (`TODO.md`)
  - Current priorities organized by phase
  - Weekly goals and daily tasks
  - Completed items tracking
  - Ideas and future features

- **✅ Updated README.md**
  - Added links to new documentation
  - Simplified phase overview
  - Removed redundant roadmap details

## 🎯 Current State

### What's Working
- Homepage is deployed (should be working after Railway picks up the fix)
- Starfield animation
- Night sky branding
- Header scroll behavior
- Documentation is comprehensive and organized

### What Needs Work
- Node.js not installed locally (needed for Phase 1.2)
- TALL stack not fully set up (Tailwind and Alpine.js pending)
- Component architecture not implemented yet
- Content pages not created yet

---

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Verify Railway Deployment (User Action Required)
After Railway picks up the commit:
1. Visit https://railway.app dashboard
2. Check the build logs
3. Verify the build succeeds
4. Visit the deployed site
5. Test all functionality:
   - Homepage loads
   - Starfield animation works
   - Header scroll behavior works
   - All assets load correctly
   - Mobile responsive

**If the build still fails:**
- Check Railway logs for specific errors
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check that `APP_KEY` is generated
- Review the deployment guide in `docs/MASTER_ROADMAP.md`

### 2. Install Node.js (User Action Required for Phase 1)
To continue with TALL stack setup:
1. Go to https://nodejs.org
2. Download LTS version (currently 20.x)
3. Install on your machine
4. Restart terminal/IDE
5. Verify: `node --version` and `npm --version`
6. Run `npm install` in the project directory
7. Run `npm run dev` to start Vite dev server

### 3. Continue with Phase 1 Tasks
Once Node.js is installed:
- Install Tailwind CSS
- Install Alpine.js
- Create component library
- Build content pages

See `TODO.md` for detailed task list.

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### Technology Decisions
1. **TALL Stack**: Tailwind, Alpine.js, Laravel, Livewire
   - Reason: Consistent with existing repos, Laravel-native
   
2. **Railway Hosting**: Continue using Railway
   - Reason: Already set up, auto-deploy from GitHub

3. **Night Sky Theme**: Maintain throughout all features
   - Reason: Strong brand identity, consistent UX

4. **Guest-Friendly Approach**: Allow playing without account
   - Reason: Lower barrier to entry, better user acquisition

5. **One Feature at a Time**: Extract and integrate sequentially
   - Reason: Reduces complexity, allows thorough testing

### Pending Decisions
- F1 API choice (Ergast vs FastF1 vs manual entry)
- Wiki platform (custom Laravel vs Wiki.js vs MediaWiki)
- User authentication system (Breeze vs Jetstream)
- Real-time solution (Pusher vs Laravel Reverb vs WebSockets)

## 🚀 How to Contribute

### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/feature-name`
2. Make changes
3. Test thoroughly
4. Commit with conventional commits: `git commit -m "feat: description"`
5. Push to GitHub: `git push origin feature/feature-name`
6. Create Pull Request (or merge directly to main for solo development)
7. Railway auto-deploys after merge

### Conventional Commit Format
```
