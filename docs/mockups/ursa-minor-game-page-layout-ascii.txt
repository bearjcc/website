WHAT THE USER SEES AFTER CLICKING A GAME
----------------------------------------
1. Same chrome: header (Logo, Home, Games, About) so they know they're still on Ursa Minor.
2. Game identity: motif + name + one-line tagline (what this game is).
3. One clear next action: Play. No competing CTAs.
4. Optional: Rules (for new players), More games (to browse elsewhere).

TAKEAWAYS
---------
- NYT: Game name prominent; focus is the play area. We use that for the play view; this mockup is the landing before play.
- Papergames: Hero (thumb + title + tagline) + "How do you want to play?" We simplify to hero + one Play button.
- Neal.fun: Minimal chrome; grid-first. We keep one primary CTA, no section bloat.
- DESIGN_BIBLE: No noise. One star in the constellation = one primary action.
