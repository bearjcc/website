STRUCTURE SUMMARY
-----------------
1. Global nav (mega or simple links)
2. Hero: one big title + one short tagline
3. Intro block: "Puzzles for every solver" + CTA
4. Game grid: cards with icon, name, one-line description (3-4 cols, responsive)
5. "View all games" link
6. Editorial/announcement strip (one featured story)
7. "Learn more" links (columns, hints, community)

TAKEAWAYS FOR URSA MINOR
------------------------
- Single hero word + one sentence is enough.
- Game cards: icon + title + one line; grid not list.
- One "latest/feature" slot keeps page fresh.
- "Learn more" can map to blog, hints, or dev notes.
- Keep footer minimal; no purple gradients.
